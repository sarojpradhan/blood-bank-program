# blood-bank-program
This is a simple console Java program. I created this project to teach Java programming to one of my friend.
The program is powered with following features:
1) Displays menu for end user to select
2) Allow end users to add blood in the blood bank
3) Allow end users to take blood from the blood bank
4) Displays the current status of blood in blood bank
5) Allow users to end the program
